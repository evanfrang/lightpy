## Introduction

LightPy is a project to simulate optics phenomena using the Angular Spectrum Method (ASM).
Currently, you can run single slit, double slit, and circular aperture experiments.
Also, I have the theoretical intensity curves for comparison, and they seem to agree in certain regions of parameter space.

## Parameters

You can play around with parameters with the json files in the config folder.
The single slit params file looks like this:

```json
{
    "experiment_type": "single_slit",
    "simulation": {
        "wavelength_nm": 500,
        "Nx": 8192,
        "Ny": 1024,
        "Lx_mm": 50.0,
        "Ly_mm": 10.0,
        "z_prop_m": 0.5
    },
    "aperture_params": {
        "width_um": 100.0,
        "height_mm": 1.0
    },
    "plot_limits": {
        "initial_field_xlim_mm_zoom": 0.2,
        "initial_field_ylim_mm_zoom": 1.0,
        "diffraction_pattern_xlim_mm": 10.0
    }
}
```

Nx and Ny are the number of pixels of the simulation, and Lx_mm, Ly_mm are the lengths of the simulation.
z_prop_m is the distance from the aperture to the screen.

## Running the Simulation

To run the experiments there is a notebook called running_experiments.ipynb in the notebooks folder that will get you started.
If you change the simulation files found in src then you will have to restart the kernel and rerun the header code.
Changing the params files you can just rerun the experiments.

## Results

Here are the diffraction patterns that the simulation outputs (blue) and comparison to theory (red dashed).
