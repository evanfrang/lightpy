## Introduction

LightPy is a project to simulate optics phenomena using the Angular Spectrum Method (ASM).
Currently, you can run single slit, double slit, and circular aperture experiments.
Also, I have the theoretical intensity curves for comparison, and they seem to agree in certain regions of parameter space.

## Python Requirements

I am using python 3.12 for development and running it seems like you should have python >= 3.10.
There is a requirements.txt file that contains the necessary python libraries.
I removed all jupyter dependencies because it was very bloated so if you want to run in a notebook install jupyter into your env.

To produce a virtual environment with the necessary libs:

On linux:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install jupyter
```
On Windows:
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install jupyter
```

## Parameters

You can play around with parameters with the json files in the config folder.
The single slit params file looks like this:

```json
{
    "experiment_type": "single_slit",
    "simulation": {
        "wavelength_nm": 500,
        "Nx": 16000,
        "Ny": 480,
        "Lx_mm": 50.0,
        "Ly_mm": 10.0,
        "z_prop_m": 0.5
    },
    "aperture_params": {
        "width_um": 100.0,
        "height_mm": 5.0
    },
    "plot_limits": {
        "initial_field": {
            "xmin_mm": -0.5,
            "xmax_mm": 0.5,
            "ymin_mm": -1.0,
            "ymax_mm": 1.0
        },
        "diffraction_pattern_1d": {
            "xmin_mm": -8.0,
            "xmax_mm": 8.0
        },
        "diffraction_pattern_2d": {
            "xmin_mm": -10.0,
            "xmax_mm": 10.0,
            "ymin_mm": -5.0,
            "ymax_mm": 5.0
        }
    }
}
```

Nx and Ny are the number of pixels of the simulation, and Lx_mm, Ly_mm are the lengths of the simulation.
z_prop_m is the distance from the aperture to the screen.

Plot limits is where you can change the plot limits of the three plots that are currently produced when running the experiment.

## Validation

There is a validation check for three potential simulation issues:

Fresnel Number Check, Nyquist Criterion, and Wrap-Around Check

Running the validation will give a printout if the checks are passed and what to do if not.

```python
run_all_checks("single_slit_basic.json")
```
```
--- Simulation Parameter Checks ---
Fresnel Number (Fn): 0.0400
  -> Fraunhofer (far-field) approximation likely valid for theoretical comparison.

Nyquist Criterion (Spatial Resolution):
  Max reliable distance (X): 40.13 mm
  Max reliable distance (Y): 6.00 mm
  Plotting range (X): +/- 10.00 mm
  Plotting range (Y): +/- 5.00 mm
  -> Pixel sizes (dx, dy) are adequate for the specified plot range.

Wrap-Around Margin (Simulation Window Size):
  Current Lx: 50.00 mm, Ly: 10.00 mm
  Estimated Required Lx: 15.00 mm, Ly: 15.00 mm
  WARNING: Ly (10.00 mm) might be too small. Recommended Ly for wrap-around is at least 15.00 mm.
  -> Consider increasing Lx_mm and Ly_mm significantly.
---------------------------------
```


## Running the Simulation

To run the experiments there is a notebook called running_experiments.ipynb that will get you started.
If you change the simulation files found in lightpy/ then you will have to restart the kernel and rerun the header code.

If you just want to run using just python there is a starter script in the scripts folder.

Changing the params files you can just rerun the experiments.

## Results

Here are the diffraction patterns that the simulation outputs (blue) and comparison to theory (red dashed).
